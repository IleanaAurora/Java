Assignment 8                                                 Files

There are four bases found in dna, A (adenine), C (cytosine), G (guanine), 
and T (thymine).  Three consecutive non-overlapping bases forms a codon.  
Since there are four bases, there are 64 possible codons. 

You are going to write a program that reads a file containing a dna sequence
and count the frquencey of each codon.  The file "ecoli.txt" contains the dna 
sequence for one type of ecoli. Your program should read this file and store
the dna sequence in a string.  You should then scan the string and count the 
number of occurrences of each codon.  A dna sequence can be read in three 
different ways, starting at position 0, starting at position 1, or starting at 
position 2.  For this exercise we will start at position 0.

The file "codons.txt" contains a list of the 64 possible codons.  You can use the 
contents of this file rather than generating the codons.
